Some fun exercises from java lessons




Some exercises to practice java arrays and StdAudio library from Princeton University 
https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdAudio.html


Requires to have StdAudio.class files in same directory to use. (StdOut.java and StdOut.class files added in repo for ease - Copyright © 2000–2017, Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.)


This repo is to host some exercises that I though of coding while reading some concepts and basic code for simpler problem from booksite - https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/ .


1. Chromatic440.java --- takes one command line argument duration and plays 12 notes (+1 from octave above) from Chromatic scale of ConcertA

2. ChordMajor.java. -- Takes two command line arguments. 
  First integer : (0 for A major chord from ConcertA chromatic scale - starting 440hz, 1 for A# or Bb and so on).  
  Second double duration : for how long to play chord
